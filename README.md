# Word_Raider
Building an Interactive Game

## This project compiles all of the concepts mentioned below to create a functional and interactive word-guessing game.:
Using print statements
Defining variables of various data types
Using lists and loops
Creating and checking conditional statements
Reading data from a file

###  Creating the Word Bank game
Our word-guessing game will prompt the player to guess a 5-letter word. As the player submits their word guess, the game will provide some feedback as to whether the letters within their guess are in the word to guess.

###  Rules of game
If the player guesses the correct letter in the correct position, that letter will be filled in on the console.
If they guess a correct letter that belongs in the word, but it is in the wrong position, that letter will be added to a list of misplaced letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position on the console. 
If they guess an incorrect letter that does not belong in the word, that letter will be added to a list of incorrect letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position on the console. 
The user will have a maximum of 5 tries to guess the word.

### Learning from this project
In this project, I practiced using several Python components to build a word-guessing game:

Defined the goal and requirements of the game.
Determined what game variables needed to be used throughout the game.
Defined the game loop where the game logistics and decision-making occurred.
Informed the player whether they won or lost the game.

### What can be done in future to work on this project

Modify  game and word bank to use a different letter length of words.
Modify the game rules and adjust the appropriate areas within  code to follow the new specifications of existing game.
Create easy or hard levels of the game that allow for more or less number of tries.
